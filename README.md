# swe-agent
A simple SWE Agent for the SWE Benchmark

Using this repository for the ["GenAI Workshop with Weights & Biases"](https://www.commudle.com/communities/machine-learning-kolkata/events/ml-workshop-with-weights-biases) event happening in Kolkata in collaboration with ML Kolkata and Weigths and Biases. This is an in-person event without any recording available. Even if you cannot attend the event, the repository might be useful/insightful.

We are attempting to build a simple SWE Agent (Code Agent) that can solve GitHub issues. This simple demonstration will show the core concepts of building an Agentic workflow. The ideas can be translated to other domains where agents make sense.

More updates coming soon...
